# photo-gallery-customizations

The purpose of this repo is to collect ideas of how a website with photo gallery should best look

## Steps to contribute
- Fork this repo.
- Add your images and designs in a new folder (with your name preferrably) under assets folder.
- Also create a README.md file for your folder describing why your design will best suit for gallery view according to you.
- Submit your PR

## Note
- You could take inspiration from exisiting websites for your designs, but please do mention credits to the original source and theme.
- Submissions can be in the form of Wireframes, html/css or even screenshots.
- This is my first attempt at being a maintainer for a project, for Hacktoberfest 2022.
